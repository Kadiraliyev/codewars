// ❓ Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

// Examples
// Valid arrays
// a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
// b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
// comp(a, b) returns true because in b 121 is the square of 11, 14641 is the square of 121, 20736 the square of 144, 361 the square of 19, 25921 the square of 161, and so on. It gets obvious if we write b's elements in terms of squares:

// a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
// b = [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]
// Invalid arrays
// If, for example, we change the first number to something else, comp is not returning true anymore:

// a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
// b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
// comp(a,b) returns false because in b 132 is not the square of any number of a.

// a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]
// b = [121, 14641, 20736, 36100, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
// comp(a,b) returns false because in b 36100 is not the square of any number of a.

// Remarks
// a or b might be [] or {} (all languages except R, Shell).
// a or b might be nil or null or None or nothing (except in C++, COBOL, Crystal, D, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, F#, Haskell, Nim, OCaml, Pascal, Perl, PowerShell, Prolog, PureScript, R, Racket, Rust, Shell, Swift).
// If a or b are nil (or null or None, depending on the language), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.

// ✅ Solution:

function comp(array1, array2) {
  if (!array1 || !array2) return false;

  const countFrequency = (arr) => {
    return arr.reduce((acc, num) => {
      acc[num] = (acc[num] || 0) + 1;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  };

  const freq1 = countFrequency(array1.map((num) => num * num));
  const freq2 = countFrequency(array2);

  const keys1 = Object.keys(freq1);
  const keys2 = Object.keys(freq2);

  if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) return false;

  for (const key of keys1) {
    if (freq1[key] !== freq2[key]) return false;
  }

  return true;
}

// ❓Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…
// … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

// How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or
// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
// or
// [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
// You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:

// ["WEST"]
// or
// { "WEST" }
// or
// [West]
// Other examples:
// In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.

// The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

// In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].

// Task
// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

// The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
// The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
// The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {North, East, West, South}.
// See more examples in "Sample Tests:"
// Notes
// Not all paths can be made simpler. The path ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"] is not reducible. "NORTH" and "WEST", "WEST" and "SOUTH", "SOUTH" and "EAST" are not directly opposite of each other and can't become such. Hence the result path is itself : ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"].
// if you want to translate, please ask before translating.

// ✅ Solution:
function dirReduc(arr) {
  const opposites = {
    NORTH: "SOUTH",
    SOUTH: "NORTH",
    EAST: "WEST",
    WEST: "EAST",
  };

  const stack = [];

  for (let direction of arr) {
    if (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] === opposites[direction]) {
      stack.pop(); // Remove the last direction if it is opposite to the current direction
    } else {
      stack.push(direction); // Otherwise, add the current direction to the stack
    }
  }

  return stack;
}
