// ❓ You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

// Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

// []                                -->  "no one likes this"
// ["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
// ["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
// ["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
// ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
// Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

// ✅ Solution:

function likes(names) {
  switch (names.length) {
    case 0:
      return "no one likes this";
    case 1:
      return `${names[0]} likes this`;
    case 2:
      return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`;
    case 3:
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
    default:
      return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${
        names.length - 2
      } others like this`;
  }
}

// ❓ Trolls are attacking your comment section!

// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

// ✅ Solution:

function disemvowel(str) {
  return str.replace(/[aeiouAEIOU]/g, "");
}

// ❓ You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

// Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

// ✅ Solution:

function isValidWalk(walk) {
  if (walk.length !== 10) {
    return false;
  }

  let x = 0,
    y = 0;

  for (let direction of walk) {
    switch (direction) {
      case "n":
        y += 1;
        break;
      case "s":
        y -= 1;
        break;
      case "e":
        x += 1;
        break;
      case "w":
        x -= 1;
        break;
    }
  }

  return x === 0 && y === 0;
}

// ❓ Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

// For example (Input --> Output):

// 39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit, there are 3 multiplications)
// 999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2, there are 4 multiplications)
// 4 --> 0 (because 4 is already a one-digit number, there is no multiplication)

// ✅ Solution:
function persistence(num) {
  let count = 0;

  while (num >= 10) {
    num = num
      .toString()
      .split("")
      .reduce((acc, digit) => acc * digit, 1);
    count++;
  }

  return count;
}
